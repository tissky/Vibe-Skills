# Distribution Governance Closure Report (2026-03-13)

## Outcome

Distribution-governance hardening is complete at the canonical governance layer.

This phase closed the registry, disclosure, provenance, and gate-infrastructure
 gaps needed to make upstream distribution governance auditable.

## Delivered

- Canonical distribution tier registry:
  `config/distribution-tiers.json`
- Canonical governance policies:
  - `docs/distribution-governance.md`
  - `docs/upstream-distribution-governance.md`
  - `docs/origin-provenance-policy.md`
- Vendor retention contract:
  - `vendor/README.md`
  - `vendor/upstreams/.gitkeep`
  - `vendor/mirrors/.gitkeep`
- Origin record scaffold:
  - `templates/ORIGIN.md.tmpl`
  - `scripts/governance/new-origin-record.ps1`
- Public disclosure surface aligned to canonical truth:
  - `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`
- Canonical registry enrichment:
  - `config/upstream-lock.json`
  - `config/upstream-source-aliases.json`
- Governance gates added or repaired:
  - `scripts/verify/vibe-third-party-disclosure-parity-gate.ps1`
  - `scripts/verify/vibe-upstream-lock-coverage-gate.ps1`
  - `scripts/verify/vibe-origin-provenance-gate.ps1`
  - `scripts/verify/vibe-upstream-mirror-freshness-gate.ps1`
  - `scripts/verify/vibe-upstream-corpus-manifest-gate.ps1`

## Verification Status

### Pass

- `outputs/verify/vibe-third-party-disclosure-parity-gate.json`
- `outputs/verify/vibe-upstream-lock-coverage-gate.json`
- `outputs/verify/vibe-origin-provenance-gate.json`
- `outputs/verify/vibe-upstream-corpus-manifest-gate.json`

### Carry-Forward Failure

- `outputs/verify/vibe-upstream-mirror-freshness-gate.json`

This remains `FAIL` for a real inventory reason, not a governance-schema reason.
The required freshness baseline root is missing four manifest slugs:

- `agent-s`
- `browser-use`
- `letta`
- `mem0`

That failure is intentionally carried forward into the repo-convergence phase
because it requires mirror inventory reconciliation and manifest/head closure.

## Non-Runtime Statement

This phase did not change:

- router semantics
- runtime ownership model
- install behavior
- bundled execution contracts

The work stayed in governance, disclosure, registry, and verification layers.

## Exit Criteria

Distribution-governance phase is considered closed because:

1. canonical truth surfaces now agree on disclosed upstream scope
2. provenance and vendor-retention governance now have explicit contracts
3. the new governance gates are runnable and produce auditable artifacts
4. the only remaining failure is a repo-inventory freshness issue owned by the
   next phase, not a missing governance control
