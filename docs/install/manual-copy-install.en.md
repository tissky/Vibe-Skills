# Manual Copy Install (Offline / No-Admin / Other Agents)

This is the second main install path.

Use it when:

- you do not want AI to execute install commands for you
- the environment is offline
- you do not have admin rights
- your target host is not `codex`, `claude-code`, or `opencode`
- you only want to place the runtime-core first and wire the host yourself later

## What You Get

Manual copy install gives you **runtime-core**, not host-native closure.

That means you get:

- `skills/`
- `commands/`
- `config/upstream-lock.json`
- `config/skills-lock.json` if present
- the canonical `skills/vibe/` runtime mirror

It does **not** automatically give you:

- host plugin provisioning
- MCP registration
- provider credential wiring
- host-native settings closure

## Manual Copy Steps

Assume your target directory is: `<TARGET_ROOT>`

1. Create the target directory layout

```bash
mkdir -p <TARGET_ROOT>/skills <TARGET_ROOT>/commands <TARGET_ROOT>/config
```

2. Copy runtime-core skills

```bash
cp -R ./bundled/skills/. <TARGET_ROOT>/skills/
```

3. Copy commands

```bash
cp -R ./commands/. <TARGET_ROOT>/commands/
```

4. Copy lock files

```bash
cp ./config/upstream-lock.json <TARGET_ROOT>/config/upstream-lock.json
cp ./config/skills-lock.json <TARGET_ROOT>/config/skills-lock.json
```

If `skills-lock.json` is not present, skip it.

## The Most Important Rule For Other Agents

If you are not installing into `codex`, and especially if you are wiring another agent, you must provide these three values yourself:

- `url`
- `apikey`
- `model`

Those values should be filled into local host settings or local environment variables by the user, not pasted into chat.

If those three values are not explicitly configured, the environment must not be described as online-ready.

## Short Prompt For Other Agents

You can place this in the target agent's system prompt or developer prompt:

```text
You are running with VibeSkills runtime-core.
Before claiming the environment is ready, check whether the user has explicitly provided:
- url
- apikey
- model
If any of them is missing, clearly remind the user to configure all three in local host settings or local environment variables first.
Do not ask the user to paste secrets into chat.
Do not describe the environment as online-ready if they are missing.
```

## When Not To Use This Path

Prefer prompt-based install instead when:

- you are installing into `codex`
- you are installing into `claude-code`
- you want the script to run install + check for you
- you want AI to select the correct lane first
